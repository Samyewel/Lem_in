Input error-checking criteria:
- If checking first line, read number of ants
- If line contains '-', read links
- If line contains ' ', read coordinates and names
- If line contains '#', read comments

To-do:
- Storing shortest path from start to end
	- Backtrack path found in bfs
- Edmonds_karp:
	- Increase flow in each iteration of bfs in edmonds_karp
	- Save paths found on each iteration of bfs in edmonds_karp
- Look into how to store the path data from the flow algorithm.
  Perhaps look into building a dynamic array system?
