Input error-checking criteria:
- If checking first line, read number of ants
- If line contains '-', read links
- If line contains ' ', read coordinates and names
- If line contains '#', read comments

To-do:
- Storing shortest path from start to end
	- Backtrack path found in bfs
- Edmonds_karp:
	- Increase flow in each iteration of bfs in edmonds_karp
	- Save paths found on each iteration of bfs in edmonds_karp
- Look into how to store the path data from the flow algorithm.
  Perhaps look into building a dynamic array system?


Lem_in tester errors: To test aarons "sh test_error.sh error(_2, _3)/$1

err_dup -> prints double
err_empty.map -> seg fault
err_link_to_unk -> seg fault
err_no_ants -> no solution
err_no_end.map -> seg fault
err_no_rooms.map -> seg fault
err_no_start and 2.map -> seg fault

Needed:

Print the map_info before
add Turn counter
add any other flags if wanted
ft_strerror doesnt work with .sh tests
read_ants separetly?
